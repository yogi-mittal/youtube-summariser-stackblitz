      Transcript:
      all right Earlier today the CEOs of NPR PBS appeared before lawmakers on the newly formed Doge subcommittee hoping to shore up more of your hard-earned tax dollars Needless to say there was plenty of fireworks Take a look First of all I do want to say that NPR acknowledges that we were mistaken and failing to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story more aggressively and sooner Do you believe that America is addicted to white supremacy um I believe that I tweeted that and I as I've said earlier I believe much of my thinking has evolved over the last half decade Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white democracy i don't believe that sir You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading at at the time apparently The Case for Reparations I don't think I've ever read that book sir You tweeted about it You said you took a day off to fully read The Case for Reparations You put that on Twitter in January of 2020 Do you believe that white people inherently feel superior to other races i do not You don't You You tweeted something to that effect You said "I I grew up feeling superior." Ha How white of me Why did you tweet that few years ago NPR educated America about quote the whole community of genderqueer dinosaur enthusiast Do you think that that's an inappropriate use of tax dollars your health adviser at NPR also stated in an interview that quote "Fear of fatness is more harmful than actual fat." Would you like to explain how fear of fatness is more harmful than actual fat that's directly That's an editorial at NPR I am not familiar with the editorial and I don't believe that was published during my time here It's called Diet Culture is Everywhere Here's How to Fight It Do you think that that's an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars i think uh any reporting on health is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars Yes Has Miss Piggy ever been caught trying to funnel billions of dollars in government contracts to herself and to her companies how about Arthur the Arvark has he ever fired independent government watchd dogs who are investigating his companies you believe your reporters are fair you said they're fair and they're working at it I believe that they work today every day Sir they're nonbiased and yet you have the voter registration issue I mean we're all human beings We're all going to see through the world through a certain lens And do you are you aware of any Republicans any registered Republicans in your newsroom i couldn't say registered but I know we have conservatives in our newsroom Yes Okay So the reg the recent registration uh when it was looked at 87 87 Democrats and zero Republicans registered I found that very concerning Yeah I would Not even 40 to 30 or 50 to 20 87 to zero I don't even know how to react to that So we have to bring in Fox News contributor senior writer by the way for the Washington Examiner Joe Kcha I'll let you respond to that because I have you know one word two words depending on how you want to say it Check and mate Checkmate Yeah I I feel like asking a question or two which is how did somebody not pull a fire alarm or call 911 because I've never seen such a blowout on on Capitol Hill like that before I mean it was just generally hilarious and Sean to hear Katherine Mayor say her past statements and social media posts some of which that were just read there during that mon or that montage had no bearing whatsoever on NPR's editorial decisions I mean go listen to NPR for 3 minutes Trust me you'll have a decidedly different opinion And if any of the folks from Doge are are watching this and we're watching today Elon if you're looking for some waste that could be really easy to cut look no further than you know MSNPR or MSPBS And and as you just showed Sean its CEO Katherine Maher was a human Chernobyl on Capitol Hill today I mean the fact that during the Biden years it really was you almost felt sorry for her almost Uh but during the Biden years NPR here's one example They stopped its tradition 50-year tradition of reading the Declaration of Independence on Independence Day That's nice right instead they decided that having a discussion on how Thomas Jefferson and the Declaration of Independence were actually racist Yeah They thought that was a better idea I mean Mayor alone she called President Trump a racist a sociopath during the 2020 election all while sporting a Biden for president hat It's on social media You could go see it So at this point if she keeps this up if the CEO of PBS keeps this up they they'll both be co-hosting The View by next week And the big question here in the end why should even one American taxpayer dollar be given to PBS or NPR because according to Pew Research the audiences at NPR and PBS are among the most liberal in America Nearly 3/4 for example of NPRs and PBS's audience describe themselves as consistently liberal Almost no conservatives watch So you know what's the old slogan here fair and balanced doesn't exist there So I say make PBS and NPR be solvent on their own Just like every other news outlet they've been around at least NPR has for 55 years The government does not need to hold their hand and give them money anymore So the whole community of gender queer dinosaur enthusiasts fear of fatness is more harmful than an actual than actual fat I think my my favorite answer though was she said that she thinks her thinking has evolved over the last half decade That means in the last five years Okay that means the person that believed America is addicted to white supremacy the person that believed that America believes in black plunder and white democracy the case for reparations uh which she put out there and that white people are inherently feel superior to other races So we're supposed to believe that her thinking has evolved in the last five years And we're we're supposed to believe that Sounds to me like an election year conversion Like this is a I want to stay uh on my job and have the taxpayers fund my great way of life and I'll say anything to save my job You get the last word Yeah In 2020 she believed that seat belts uh and doorways uh were a part of fat phobia But then in the last 5 years that whole thought process went went away All I know is Democrats when they flip-flop to try to save their jobs or just try to conform to what the public wants to hear Uh that's called evolving For everybody else that's called flip-flop flopping and phoniness In the end elections have consequences And the fact that Donald Trump and JD Vance are in office uh and Elon Musk for that matter and what he's doing up Doge it's a very good bet that the taxpayer spot is about to end at NPR and PBS and it can't happen soon enough Sean Katherine Maher you might want to start packing up your office right
