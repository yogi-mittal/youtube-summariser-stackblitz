K YOU SO MUCH. FOR MORE ON THIS LET'S BRING IN FORMER KENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND 1792 EXCHANGE CEO DANIEL CAMERON WHO IS ALSO A SENATE CANDIDATE. DANIEL GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. I WANT TO GET TO A NUMBER OF INJUNCTIONS AND CASES BUT LET'S START WITH THE USAID RULING As YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE M.A.D.D. WRITTEN RIVERA IT IS A TOUGH WIN FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT? >> IT IS A TERRIFIC WIN FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THEIR PERSEVERANCE, JUDGE WAS EXACTLY RIGHT. UNCONVENTIONAL DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN CON CONVENTIONAL HE WAS ELECTED TO CUT WASTE AND FRAUD AND ABUSE AND IT WAS A HAVEN FOR THE RADICAL LEFT. AGAINWET TO SEE A PRESIDENT THAT IS CUTTING WASTE, FRAUD AND ABUSE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS ELECTED ON AS A CONSERVATIVE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR 30 YEARS. RONALD REAGAN STARTED IT AND DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. GRIFF: IT IS INTERESTING YOU TALK ABOUT REAGAN AND DANIEL I CAN REMEMBER BACK IN THE 90s I WAS WORKING IN TALK RADIO RUSH LIMBAUGH TALKED ABOUT ANY ONE OF THESE EXAMPLES OF WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE WOULD BE A STORY FOR A WEEK. NOW, WE'RE LEARNING IN THE INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER ELON SAYING THAT THEY HAVE UPWARDS OF A BILLION DOLLAR FINES ON A NEAR REGULAR BASIS. >> IT IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS THAT THE U.S. AID PROGRAM AND BUREAUCRACY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN ROGUE. WE SAW THIS BACK STARTING WITH THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WHERE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO PUSH POPULATION CONTROL THROUGH U.S. AID. IT'S GOTTEN WORSE, OR GOTTEN WORSE UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WHERE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY RYING TO PUSH THE TRANSMANIA IF YOU WILL OR TRANSGENDERISM ON OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT ULTIMATELY THAT WAS BAD FOR WHOLE HOST OF REASONS. ONE OF WHICH -- MAIN OF WHICH IS THAT AMERICANS DON'T WANT THAT SORT OF NONSENSE WITHIN THEIR PROGRAMS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF UNITED STATES. AND I'M AGAIN, PLEASED BEYOND IMAGINATION THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITH THE CUTS THAT U.S. AID AGAIN, WHETHER IT'S DOGE, OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, THEY ARE ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT GOVERNMENT IS WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. >> LET ME SWITCH GEARS TO OTHER SIGNIFICANT RULING YESTERDAY THAT IS -- OVER THE DEPORTATIONS UNDER THE 1798 ALIEN ENEMIES ACT, YOU SAW JUDGE BOASBERG PUT THAT TEMPORARILY RESTRAINING ORDER ON IT, D.C. THREE JUDGE PANEL RULED AGAINST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SO THE TRUMP TEAM TOOK THIS TO THE SUPREME COURT ASKING THEM TO RESUME SUCH DEPORTATION FIGHTS AS VENEZUELAN AND TAKEN TO EL SALVADOR TO THE MEGA PRISON. WHAT'S YOUR READ ON THIS? WHERE'S THIS HEADED? >> I'M OPTIMISTIC THAT SUPREME COURT WILL RULE IN FAVOR OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LOOK, JUST THIS PAST WEEK, YOU SAW A RINGLEADER OF THE MS-13 APPREHENDED BY THE FBI. THAT'S THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP WE NEED FOR THE COUNTRY. WE'VE GOT TO KEEP OUR FOLKS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SAFE. GET -- HOPEFUL OPT MISTAKE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE IN FAVOR OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SAFE STREETS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHY TRUMP WAS VOTED IN OVERWHELMINGLY. HE'S THE LAW AND ORDER PRESIDENT. HE'S GOING GET OUR STREETS SAFE AGAIN AND I'M OPTIMISTIC HOPEFUL THAT THE SUPREME COURT WILL ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO IMPORTANT WORK HERE. >> LASTLY DANIEL I WAS TO ADDRESS OVERALL GENERAL NUMBER OF JUDGES INJUNCTIONS YOU CAN LOOK AND SEE ACROSS THE PAST FEW PRESIDENCIES. YOU'VE GOT 12 FOR OBAMA'S TWO TERMS. 14 UNDER BIDEN SIX UNDER BUSH. 64 UNDER TRUMP FIRST ADMINISTRATION SO FAR IN JUST THE PAST TEN WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN 17 INJUNCTIONS. DO YOU SEE THESE COURTS REALLY OUTSIDE OF THEIR JURISDICTION WITH THESE RULINGS? >> GRIFF. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHETHER IT WAS WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS STILL A CITIZEN OR EVEN NOW WE'RE SEEING WEAPONIZATION OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT SIMPLY IS -- IS ULTIMATELY TRYING TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO THE TRUMP AGENDA. IT IS, OBVIOUSLY, AWFUL TO SEE THIS HAPPENING. I'M HOPEFUL THAT AGAIN ONCE THESE CASINGS MAKE THEIR WAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS INTO THE SUPREME COURT, WE'RE GOING GET SOME GOOD AND FAVORABLE RULINGS THAT A -- ALLOW ADMINISTRATION TO PROCEED AND PROTECT THE AMERICAN WORKER. PROTECT AMERICAN FAMILIES, AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ENTER INTO THIS GOLDEN AGE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TALKED ABOUT. GRIFF: IN THE LAST TEN SECONDS OR SO I'VE GOT DO YOU BELIEVE THERE'S A HOUSE HEARING ABOUT JUDGES DO YOU BELIEVE JUDGES SHOULD POTENTIALLY FACE IMPEACHMENT? >> I'M PLEASED THAT THE HOUSE AND EVEN THE SENATE ARE ULTIMATELY MAKING A DECISION TO SCRUTINIZE AND HOLD THESE FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THESE FOLKS. >> DANIEL
