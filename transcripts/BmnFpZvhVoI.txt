      why would mutual funds even do that I mean they do have a fiduciary duty to take care of the money of the person you are putting money in sip because you can gift your son like a silver color Mercedes seller at some point so that he can try to impress the 17-year-old girl who he is with and say oh my dad has no time for me man should you believe in sips looking at the last 400 year history that every government is going to keep on printing money and abuse money printing to an extent that it become [Music] worthless do you want to become a Cory by trading in the stock market do you want to catch hold of multi-baggers that grow 100x 200x in a matter of months do you want to figure out which is the best mutual fund for you to do all of that you need to make sure you don't lose your money to dubious scams in the stock markets but how do you do that well you're in luck because in this episode of the fin shots money Playbook we have with us Abid Hassan he's the founder of sensible and he has been calling out fraud sters for a very long time now thank you so much for joining us Abid very very happy to be here my very first question is there are these narratives in the stock markets okay and I want you to either tell me are they right or wrong and maybe justify it about why they're right or wrong so mutual F okay technically technically M fund okay I'll tell you why right let me put you a simple example yeah see everybody talks about how much return mutual fund made they'll pull off a graph and show key or say and all that that's all true but nobody really really knows how much money the end user has made yeah and I'll tell you an interesting two three incidents right they're anecdotal of course but if you realize the kind of people to whom it is happening you'll realize this is probably way more widespread so I have a friend very good friend he has an uncle uncle retired as the cxo of one of the big MNC in it very smart guy cxo I think C right so if he was some Chief H officer or something we could have still said people please no offense C has to be a smart guy so recently uh my friend was having a conversation with Uncle and he asked uh Uncle how do you invest in mutual funds he said uh I have a person who makes me do all these sips wonderful man uh uh so that's how I invest so obviously my friend was curious and asked and how much does he charge like oh that's the best part he charges me nothing crazy and uh so so obviously this person was curious my friend was curious how can you charge nothing no I have an arrangement with him in which he takes 20% of uh whatever is the profit as his fee okay now here's the interesting part right and this has been running for 5 Years first of all he is taking 20% as his performance fee this is outright illegal right because why because you can't if you're an MF distributor you only get the commissions and you can't take like a 20% of performance fee or whatever okay that's a scami think but here is the bigger problem the bigger problem is he's already getting paid because he's selling him regular mutual fund oh it is not direct or something this distributor is selling him regular mutual fund just just tell the difference between regular and direct for direct mutual fund has very low fee regular mutual fund is like uh typically 2 to 3 person sometimes it's like half a person one person type also exists but if your very well-meaning MFD distributor advisor friend is giving you regular M trust me they like 2% 3% commission or let me put it in a different perspective right if you give your money to a MF distributor at 2 to 3% Commission in 10 years he makes 20 to 30% of your a so crazy right of course a grows and all that but imag imagine that it's stagnant so in a hypothetical scenario you are paying him 20% of your wealth saay yeah right so so about this guy who had like so now he's actually making 2 to 3% commission and as if it is not enough he is Al taking 20% cut from the cut right which is outright illegal this not where it ends so and very high commission funds he's making him invest in he's putting money in re small cap midcap kind of funds so look at it look at the perversity of uh incentives right yeah see what is the deal I make money only if I outperform 20% 30% of the return so I have no incentive to make him play safe because if I make him play safe I make very little money if he loses money I don't make any money I don't lose any money if he lose money that is also important so if I have a scheme with somebody in which I'm making a cut if he's performing and I lose nothing if he's underperforming then I'll always make him Gamble because I want so basically he was taking a fee he was taking a performance sorry high high fee mutual funds and he was basically making him Gamble and he was pretending to take no charges from him yeah and this is not the only case right I know so many incidents like the same friend I don't know why my this friend particularly has so many friends who yeah there's like a lady who was being made to invest in extremely high commission mutual fund and this guy was even trading on her account and this lady works for an NGO or something at some 65k or something per month salary and I'm like right so these guys make churn inside the portfolio see I understand if I'm managing your portfolio in stocks I buy sell Buy sell byy sell mutual friend but and this has happened to another friend of mine also in fact there was a friend's wife her bank manager told her okay B so Bank selling mutual fund is like the biggest scam of all times right because uh typically it's like typically a bank customer if a person goes to a bank to buy something you can be 90% sure because bank is like the worst scammy of all the scamm places like you never buy insurance from Bank you never buy gold from Bank you never buy anything from Bank actually right but if a person is going to a bank to buy mutual fund then God be with him but I my friend's wife this uh relationship manager managed her portfolio so brilliantly that between 2017 and 2021 or something she made 3% not cagr total that to in like one of the bull market phenomenal and because he kept on turning her portfolio in fact he used to make her trade it so much without her knowing it that he'll sell before the exit load cut time so that he makes the you get it right like one year you turn probably some there an exit load so you'll actually sell before that so they make the penalty charges also see mutual fund as a product might be a good product for creating long-term wealth there's a possibility right but who your distributor is what's his incentive but see every time somebody says keep that sip running keep that sip running you're my problem is yes I get it right that maybe you can't time the market maybe you have to do something smart I mean you can't really buy the low and uh sell the high Etc but if you're saying no matter what the condition of the market is your strategy is keep the Sip running there are two reasons one it's extreme intellectual laziness at least make the person put 20 30% in an FD or something or at least switch him to a uh debt fund but that you won't do because debt fund won't give you commission debt fund Commission are very thin right so if somebody is saying boss keep that sip running first reason of course is intellectual aess to my question is this right you're not an advis you're just a Salesman call yourself a Salesman no like see if an adviser has to give good advice but the person who keeps on asking you to buy the Sip is not an adviser he's a Salesman yeah he'll sell anything to you right my second problem of course is key that person asks you to keep on sap running not because of the good intention of it's a good strategy which I don't know if it's a good strategy or not but we'll come to that later okay he's saying that because that's the only way in which he can make money so to answer your question mutual fund say yes but say I don't think so you got it okay so we'll move to the next one we just spoke about it a little sips should you believe in sips or should you also start thinking of an Exit Plan Exit Plan say systematic selling plan see the thing is this right so I'll give a very very long-term perspective yeah your very very long-term perspective is that the world is working in such a way that the world has gotten used to an inflationary economy where governments across the world keep printing money so in the long run you can only be assured of one thing money will lose value right I don't know whether stocks will gain value gold will lose value silver will lose value or you know bonds will lose value or something but I know for a fact looking at the last 400 year history that every government is going to keep on printing money and abuse money printing to an extent that it will become worthless so then the only hedge you have against rampant money printing which keep makes sure that you're always kept poor because of inflation is you have to invest in something which is an anti-inflationary hinge realistically there are only two three things real estate gold Equity right so if you're a lay man you have no choice but to keep invest you're you're basically at a very fundamental level you're forced to invest in stock Bond sorry stock gold real estate because otherwise you'll get poorer by doing nothing yeah so to answer your question in the absence of the ability to time yes you have to keep sips running but you should also necessarily diversify in the sense that you can't be a 100% Equity guy with 100% in equity sip you have to have at least 10 20% of your money in FD okay because let's say you are look at covid right 12,000 your portfolio was worth like let's say you had a 10 portfolio just before covid just after covid your portfolio was only 6 and a half cres or something right now that is you'll still think are six cres 40% almost right but the point is imagine somebody had only 10 lakh and he had been all equity and he had kept it for some use right now suddenly he's left with 6 lakhs and maybe he has a hospitalization expense so you have to sell something at a loss to pay for that hospital but if you had FD you can actually use that without a loss you get the meta right so you always yes keep sip running but do it with money that you have absolutely no other need for if you need money for anything keep it in some liquid instrument uh and always think that you are putting money in sip because you can gift your son like a silver color Mercedes seller at some point so that he can try to impress the 17-year-old girl who he is with and say oh my dad has no time for me man that's why you put money in si but otherwise it's not for yourself so in that sense yes keep it going for your douche generational wealth for others to use for your douchebag kid okay next question is about buy the dip should people subscribe to this notion that they should buy the dip every time I know a lot of people who bought the dip in yesbank bought the dip in data Motors bought the dip in or let me put it this way right yeah everybody says the D Dawn is darkest so what's that night is night is darkest before the dawn before the dawn but nobody really tells you how much more darker it can get see if Dawn is Darkest Night is darkest before the dawn you can't start waiting for the morning do you start waiting at 12 12:30 1 are you 1:30 2 when when when is this ending right so you don't know when it is ending my problem with by the dip philosophy is that this by the dip becomes strongest on pullbacks from extreme highs because typically people get interested in stocks when they are really really in the news when everybody is jumping into it take the case of trend okay like retail actually got into Trend when it was talked about so much and Retail also got into Nifty when when did retail get into stock market did anybody bother putting money in stock market when Nifty was 8,000 after covid nobody no everybody is investing in 23,000 24,000 Nifty right so forget individual stock like Trent or s bank or something right or or any inflated IPO when it was it had gone up 50% above listing price and now it is down 60% people get it at the top because see people who are buying the dip are typically people who say and the other problem is they keep on buying the dip averaging the dip Etc again people who are asking you to buy the dip are not asking you to buy the dip because it's good for you they can't ask you to sell because in India there is no shorting you can't sh a stock right so basically they can only make money when you buy obviously they'll ask you to buy the dip right if there was a shorting of stocks in India which was widespread which people understood they'll also ask you to sell the uptick but we don't have sell the uptick because there's no shorting in which they can make there's no incentive for them in asking you to sell everybody who's asking you to buy the dip is asking you to buy the dip because they have money to gain from it I think on the same lines uh there's also this notion that the markets will always recover it's cyclical but if you see the case of some countries that's not the case Japan China China yeah China I think 2008 recovery happened like last year I think H sing did not recover where it was in 2008 till last year right so basically recover if you put if you put $1 million in Hing in 2008 and if you're left with $1 million last year that's like money has already lost its yeah and see the inflation number is not correct right because governments around the world want to report some 5 6% the true inflation is much much higher than that so if you had $1 million in 2008 oh let me put it this way ima's highest salary in 2008 was quarter million dollar okay right in UK it's probably $1 million of 2008 is not even like 200k these days right what it in terms of what it can do or the life St it can bring because real estate school education everything has become much much more expensive so yes people can always show you an S&P graph or a Nifty graph or something but for all those incidences you can also show a China or a Japan or like there are so many countries where growth has kind of tapered out right so this uh markets are always cyclical and they will recover yes and no because like I said earlier the only reality is that money will lose value So eventually money will lose value and your portfolio will be worth lot more in terms of you know uh inflated depreciated currency in the sense that uh yeah of course when money loses value the companies that are producing money they'll have to produce they'll have to be worth more in terms of the cheaper currency right so yes if you take 20 years 30 years 40 year Horizon yes but if you are going to buy some lumpsum money uh let's say so I know a lot of people who have broken anywhere between 50 lakh to 2 CR FD or real estate and put money at 24,000 25,000 levels they didn't do it because they wanted to create wealth or preserve money the only reason why they did it is because they got really jealous of the person who put money at 21,000 right so this is like a negative feeling right not happy whether you are making money or not you're unhappy somebody else made more money yeah so propelled by such emotions people put lumps some money in let's say Nifty 26,000 now let me put it this way right people who had bought 2008 Peak I think 2008 Peak was Revisited in 2013 or somethingone did nothing if you had put money in FD it would have made probably 60 70% extra so if cyclical argument if you're always systematically in in for a really really long time yes it's a good idea but yeah it will always recover bul if you're jumping into some 26,000 Nifty and putting like a very big big lumpsum shot bad idea oh now my last question in this series is uh can can someone actually be financially independent through trading they can you know leave their job and just do this and never have to you know be in this Rat Race the RS are also very nice see 9:30 to 3:30 the the RS are nice so let me ask you the reverse question right um how much money do you need to be financially independent just put a random figure on it okay 100 CR 100 I don't know like you said no money loses its value so let me just put a big number like I don't know when I'll have 100 with me and I like twice your age but okay a 10 cres okay let's be realistic 10 CR okay okay so 10 crores yeah you want to make 10 crores to be financially independent by trading right uh put me a random number on how much money you have right now right now yeah 15 lakhs 15 lakhs yeah how much do you think your performance will be every year 12% 133% as as a Trader yeah it should be phenomenal no like it should be outlier 30% 40% yeah yeah you're not going to double your money every year right okay that's not happening even if you double your money every year 40% government tax so let's do some numbers right so you want to reach 10 CR you have 15 lakh right now with you I'm going to give you like the ridiculously generous uh Assumption of you'll double your money every year okay right and that I'm again giving you a generous assumption that b in the sense you won't make a draw down or every year doubling without even a single year of draw down not a single year of bankruptcy statistics Mak 90% of the people lose money yeah right uh but let's say you make 100% return every year it'll take you 9 years to be financially independent which doesn't sound bad right 9 years out of the Matrix but let's just do some realistic who are the best in so I'm going to ask Chad GPT investors ever and what is their return so we'll just see some of the greatest invest ever Jim Simmons yeah from Renaissance Technologies roughly 39% net return that is I'm Mak more returns than him pfda yeah right 39% Warren Buffett 20% C so akanga 100% Buffet 20% George Soros who doesn't know George Soros 30% cagr so akanga 100 George Soros 30 Fidelity fidelity fun Peter lych 29% but a 100% AA 60% post tax right Stan duer Miller 30% Charlie M 20% John Templeton of Franklin Templeton 15 to 20% R of Bridge Water 12% but still Papu indor he makes 18% right car 20 to 30% Benjamin Graham 15 so basically I'll tell you whose ticket it is to get out of the Matrix so I know a telegram tipster who actually used to do fake pnl screenshots and all and say financially independent men option trade crew this person charges like roughly rup per month for uh um rup per month for a group access to that telegram group okay and the last time I check there were like some 2,000 people in that group so 2,000 into 4,000 is roughly a lakh right 8 million right your number was also 10 CR I don't know if you have Matrix ticket and all but definitely whoever tells you trading is the ticket that person one year it is possible for them but but I'll tell you something right you also have to understand why this happens and U let me put it this way right so by the way that group exists every month people lose money there but somebody else will come and newly join that group and churn and all these scammy tipsters groups right they all run on this principle of churn so I want to recollect this incident which happened to me in 2013 and I first started sensible and there was this big Indian brokerage at that point of time it was one of the top brokers in India now now they are like out of top 10 and all and I went and met their MD and CEO right he was like a very nicey sweet guy slightly older guy so he used to call me like you know beta and all that right so um and he was very you know used to give me very nice advice tell me the reality and he used to tell me I was like an idealist and yoga so I once told him sir the problem is the entire industry logo B right and uh the problem is it's basically like uh they just take the client take all their money kill him churn him move on to the next client so you have to think of client longivity right if you keep on killing clients so I told him we should have something in which we retain the clients by making sure they don't lose money etc etc sensible that's was the idea a long time back okay 2013 May when I met this guy in his Bombay office he actually tells me bet see you'll beep this word of course [Music] right customer retention is not you get keep on getting most people because and he's real right because see in India if you don't have money life is really really difficult nobody values you you won't even have have basic rights if you don't have money because no matter what even if you have something like you want to go file a complaint in a police station you probably have to have money otherwise basically Law and Order works if you have more money than the person against you probably right that's true so yeah then the point is you're really really desperate for money so here's the thing right look at like Tinder or Bumble or one of those dating apps there'll be obvious profiles there which are either catfish profiles right very obvious but there'll be still these simp boys who come and swipe them and talk to them and probably give money all why because they are that desperate to get anything in life now look at this thing similarly there are people who are ridiculously ridiculously desperate you start aam group or something and show them some hope boss of course they'll do all this right because for them life is so bad that any glimmer of hope makes them do ridiculously stupid things like if you see a slightly unfortunate friend of yours U who has taken like you you know these inel boys who keep on taking women for dates and nothing happens they never in a relationship you can tell them boss you're an idiot but the reality is not his idiocy maybe he's not an idiot he's probably doing well in so many other areas of L this one area May he's doing so badly that you T I'll take any chance right so it's like that so this is the foundation on which trading is the ticket to get out of Matrix is built desperation of people gullibility of people and the Val ridiculously disproportionate value that you give money in this Society the truth is that there's no shortcut to Los getting out of the Matrix you have to grind it out okay so uh we'll start from where companies actually enter the stock markets which is like IPOs okay so in the recent years you've probably seen that there have been many IPOs which which seemed very overvalued you know on paper the companies are probably loss making and yet those IPOs were over subscribed and not just by retail but also by mutual fund houses and and sometime later those companies like I won't name them but majority of them are you know down anywhere between 20 to 60% from the listing price why why would mutual funds even do that I mean they do have a fiduciary duty to take care of the money of the person you know who has handed their hard-earned money to them why do they not see this this clear scammy thing that's happening that okay the fundamentals are not right the valuation is not right it's probably just a exit for private Equity yeah see schools have a duty towards their students to give them good education and not screw up their life colleges Etc right Doctors Hospitals they have a responsibility to cure the disease and not right companies that make food have a responsibility that you don't feed people poison the person who comes and fits an AC in your house has a responsibility that that AC works well and not that you have to fill gas every 3 months but yet you know what is the kind of scams that happen in the world M schools are over inflating their prices and sucking the blood dry out of parents corporate hospitals sometimes keep dead patients in ICU after they are dead right I came late for this recording because I had to call the AC G by the way because the first AC guy fitted AC in such a way that there was a leak in the copper pipe so he'll have to keep on we'll have to call him every I have filled the gas twice in the last two years and today the person I called was a nice guy he actually pointed out okay mutual fund managers are going to be any different yeah like we live in an era of fraud of unprecedented fraud fraud has percolated Education Health Care food Hospital everything is corrupt and I sometimes can't help but laugh at your naivity which is saying let's say I am a promoter and you are like a fund manager right and I want to dump my stock because I know this I am iping only because I know it won't grow any further if it's going to go up higher most probably right I'm saying nine out of 10 cases if I'm you know probably listing my IPO stock of anme and let me put this here right it is so murky this entire business now that I recently read a Twitter thread by somebody which was exposing some IPO or listing of some small company they said that their business model is that they export some kind of an element to China that's how they make their revenues only problem is it does not exist in periodic table weum business vibranium sorry captain exporting from so this is the kind of stuff that happens right see regular see healthare should not cheat people education should not food should not screw people right I mean there are incidents of what a popular food man manufacturer has done to mothers in Africa oh yeah to promote the sales of their formula right that is of corruption that uh exists in the corporate capitalist system we live in right East India Company right what do you think that did to this country right or look at what king Leopold of Belgium did in Congo to support his cronies mutual fund managers are going to act in the way I don't even get it so very simply put yeah yes on paper there is a fiduciary responsibility and all but you're wake up yeah if you're watching this program please wake up that's not how the world works there's no Duty there's no responsibility nothing the only reason if somebody is doing good things now is because maybe rarely 1% of the cases they might be genuinely nice people who have drawn a limit to their greed or maybe they really afraid of getting caught right my point is if there is a promoter who is kind of corrupt and if it's a mutual fund manager there's a and you can't say mutual fund managers are not corrupt like if there that was such a fundamentally nice person they probably would not have entered Finance they would have done something like save the polar bear or something but if I we are friends and you I am a promoter you are an MF guy and you are going to take public money and invest it but basically I say man you have another account in kayman or something right even I have an account in kayman Orland I'll transfer some to you later it's very possible right why should they not do it are they going to not do it because of a sense of of morality I don't think there are many occasions in life when sense of Morality In Financial Industries are more valuable than let's say even half a million dollars okay so no I don't have any proof that this has happened but I have to be an idiot to assume that this won't happen because this is consistently happening people are consistently mutual fund houses are buying these companies which are inflated loss making Y and I can't explain it see the thing is this right there's something called OK Razer simplest explanation tends to be true and simplest explanation is that I'm the promoter you the fund manager and I calling I I I have no other explanation why this is happening so people invest in the stock markets the whole story that was sold was look at the index the index has gone up the index has gone up but can the index be manipulated that question's answer is above my pay grade okay I'm not going to answer that okay but do you know the answer see my question is this very fundamentally why could it not be manipulated this is my reverse question right like are you saying that interest index can't be manipulated a bank B Bank C Bank D hft eh hft and XY Z private Equity everyone in the Layman's World think they competing with each other no bro they are all you know they are all cooperating with each other to screw us that is the reality of Finance right so if all these boys Pension funds mutual funds you know uh hfts big Banks investment B Banks trading prop Etc they all decide oh look this week all these retail people have bought like a lot of call options so see we have to invest a lot of money this week in uh Nifty or some index sensex or somea or something let me not say some Index right okay they'll be like boss yeah week now if we put our orders and if we pick up all these or if we do this rebalancing of portfolio or something or there's a huge flow coming which can push up the price of this index Etc then so theas you sold the call to that J we'll do it after Thursday or we'll do it after expiry this is a very logical conversation to have right see I'm not saying that I have any proof that uh this is happening okay all I'm saying is that if me and my friends were running really large fund houses I'll totally do it so I don't find any reason why these guys won't do it okay and see technically technically they not doing anything illegal what are they doing illegal is there any regulation which says ke you can't talk to other Traders so index can be mad could be you we don't know for sure I'll be very surprised if somebody is not trying to manipulate index let me put it that way okay somebody with the resources yeah and the immunity and a very like high likelihood of not getting caught ever okay give me one reason why he will not manipulate the index to make money got itary responsibility andal but give me a solid reason like let's say you are running a very big Investment Bank you have information of flows you are connected enough to not get caught and you have sophisticated alos which do not leave any kind of Trail right if you are unlikely to get caught if you have immunity even if you get caught and if you have the resources to do all of this and technically technically what you're operating in is not even illegal it is in a gray area right why would I not do it it's going to make me money interesting before I move into the next question I realize that we're running out of time but I do have a lot more questions to ask you so let's do this thing let's come again next week where we'll break down specific scams in the stock markets we'll talk about The Regulators across the world we'll talk about algo trading option trading and what not so do tune in and let us know what you think about this episode see you on the other side
