      hi friends have a look at my screen and you will see that this particular stock back in April 2015 used to trade at around 118 rupees level and since then it has been hammered down it has been beaten down like anything and by the time December 29 came the stock was trading at around 3 rupees level and in fact in the last 5 to six year up until August 24 if you see the stock has never managed to cross 20 rupees of barrier so this is one negative example of stocks that have beaten down badly and have never managed to go back or rebound back to their all-time high value of 118 rupees but guess what Indian stock market is full of negative stories as well as positive stories and as an investor we need to have both the views because each of these views will teach us something very very important now in contrast to this stock have a look at my screen and have a look at stock number two here back in December 2021 this stock used to trade at around 1782 rupees level this was also badly beaten down and by the time May 22 came it was down at around 543 level and in fact by the time June 2024 came it was down to 340 level losing almost 70 to 80% of its value however what happened after June 2024 for this stock is that it started to bounce back and look at the rally that It produced by the time December 24 came the stock had tripled from its bottom price and had gone to 1,000 level from almost 340 level here so this is a positive story of a beaten down stock that has managed to bounce back from 340 levels to almost 1,000 level so what's the difference between these two stocks stock one and stock 2 that stock two has managed to bounce back so the billion dollar question is that can we find out those beaten down stocks that have high odds to bounce back to very very good price levels is what I really want to discuss in this video now I'm not saying that my method is a 100% guaranteed method in fact in this entire world nobody is going to be able to produce a me method or a framework that will work 100% of times or will give you guaranteed returns if they're telling you they are bullshitting they are giving you false information but over a period of time I have learned a lot of things about beaten down stocks so in this video I'm going to run you through 10 steps that I have learned over a period of time and if you do these 10 steps then the odds are going to be in our favor where the stock may bounce back again there is nothing 100% guaranteed here but definitely these 10 steps will remove badly beaten down stocks or fundamentally weak ER beaten down stocks that's the whole intent of creating this video people will not even share this type of content with you even in 10,000 rupees 20,000 rupes of paid courses here I'm teaching this to you absolutely free of cost and if you like this video the only request I have is that let me know in the comments simple thank you the only other way I teach practically is using my YouTube Community if you're not yet a member you can consider becoming a YouTube Community member go to my channel and find the join button and be my guest I post almost on a daily basis about stocks mutual funds ETF F the feedback of this community has been excellent you are going to learn from each other as well with that let's get this video started so the first thing we are going to do is we are going to head to screener and simply create a new screen you will see this screen coming up and if you are very new I'm going to go very slow so that you understand it so step number one is to find out those stocks that have been beaten down massively how to do that very very simple simply we are going to say high price all time here okay so this will tell us what is the alltime high price of the stock now we are going to say minus the current price so that tells you how much it has fallen by but definitely we want it in percentage so what we are going to do is put the brackets here and then we are going to say multiply this by 100 and divide by high price all the time high price all time so this will give us those stocks that have been hitting alltime high price since 2005 which is going back to 20 years and if you run this query here you are going to get around 4,845 companies here now what we want this percentage to be at least more than 50% right we want a stock that has been beaten down from its all-time high price by at least 50% now this percentage could be anything you might go with 60% 70% or 80% it is your call I'm comfortable with 50% so I've gone with 50% now let's go and run this query and if we run this query we get around 2,467 companies that have beaten down by more than 50% from their all-time high price in last 20 years is the data that we have got here I'm not displaying the names of these stocks here because the name of the stocks will vary depending on when you're watching this video what I really want you to do is to learn the concept and practice it with me open the screener start typing the query believe me you are going to learn a lot right now what we are going to do is improve this query here because this is Step number one here and one thing you will note here is that we do not want those stocks that had hit all-time high price let's say back in 2010 okay we don't want that because if a stock has not recovered in the last 15 years then the odds of it recovering now is very very low in my view you never say never in stock market but still the chances are very very low so how to find out those stocks that have been recently beaten down is the question here so for that what we are going to do is we are going to add another condition here so we are going to come down here and say end give me those stocks that are down from 52 week high so last one year those stocks that have been down by more than 50% that will give me the recent data for the last one year if I run this query now I'm going to get much lesser number of stocks which is around 1232 stocks again the list of the stocks does not matter here but this is the step one to find out the stocks which have been beaten down from their all-time high price now after this the Second Step that I'm going to do here is that I'm going to apply another criteria which is the market capitalization so market cap of a stock I want it to be at least minimum let's say 2,000 right now again your choice whether you you are comfortable with 2,000 CR or if you want to go let's say 5,000 CR or 10,000 CR or 1,000 CR that is again your choice I'm comfortable with 2,000 CR so let's run this query here and now we find only 74 stocks now what this filter has done is it has got rid of those stocks that might be penny stocks or you know very low market cap here we are talking about at least some size of the company that we can deal with now comes step number three so for step number three again I'm going to write another end condition and say that the pledged percentage here should be less than 10% what is pledged percentage meaning what percentage of shares the promoters have pledged is what we need to find out and I don't want to go with any company where the promoters have pledged more than 10% of their Stakes now why 10% I'm comfortable with 10% you might go with 5% you might go with 7% the idea here is that we are not going to pick up a company where the promoters have pledged more than 10% of their Stakes because that becomes more riskier the pledge ing is never a good thing in stocks but of course there are some legitimate reasons sometimes where the promoters might go for pledging as long as it is limited we are fine with it we are still taking a risk but then we are talking about beaten down stocks here therefore it is not going to be a very very clean stock asset so what we're going to do is run this query and find out how many such stocks where the pledging is less than 10% now 62 companies where the pledging is less than 10% this is the list we can work with step number four that we are going to follow is extremely important what we we want to check is when the stock has been beaten down what has fi done what has di done what has promoters done have they really sold the stakes because it will tell us whether there is a genuine problem in the stock because dis FIS and promoters they know more than what we know as retail investors at many a times so what we are going to do here is that we are going to put another condition so we are going to say end and we are going to look at first di holding plus fi holding and we want the total percentage of this to be at least 5% that gives us some confidence that at the time of we running this query we know that the cumulative holding By Di and fi is at least more than 5% there still have some stake in the ground now if you run this query what we are going to do is we are going to see some reduction in the stocks but this alone is not enough because just imagine a stock that had total di holding plus fi holding at around 25% and in fact Di and fi have sold around 20% out of it we want that to be captured with this query alone it will not be captured so how do we capture that so that's very very simple what we are going to do is we are going to say di holding changes okay so this is the DI holding changes in the last quarter so this is very recent change and this should be less than 2% okay likewise what we are going to do is we are going to do change in fi holding again let's go ahead and have a look at that to be less than 2% and lastly I want to make sure that from a promoters perspective the changes so we go changes in promoters holding 3 years I'll tell you why I'm going for 3 years should be less than 2% now why 2% and why holding 3 years because promoters they will sense the problems or the stress areas within a company much earlier than Di and fi and the first person to sell a badly beaten down stock will be promoters we don't want to see promoter Stakes that have come down in the last 3 years we don't want that right so as long as they have not done the selling in the last 3 years by more than 2% then we are okay with that right this is an extremely important parameter a lot of ground work for you dis FIS and promoters have done for you right therefore what I'm going to do is run this query here and now we see 27 stocks on my screen these stocks where dis and FIS and promoters have maintained confidence again it doesn't still mean that we should go and look at these stocks as investing thesis but it has got rid of many badly beaten down stocks with this let's move to step number five which is to look at the valuations as well what we don't want is that a beaten down stock is still trading at a high P than the industry P that would be a disaster for us to pick a beaten down stock what I'm going to do is I'm going to put another end condition here and say that the price to earning ratio here so price to earnings ratio should be here less than the industry PE we want to make sure that we only get the stocks that are trading at a below industry PE level if you run this query again we are going to get rid of few stocks now we come to 12 stocks that have managed to come into our list that makes a lot of sense in my view now we need to find out that out of these limited 12 stocks which stocks are going to make more sense and for that we are going to execute step number six screener job is done we are now going to look at the individual research on particular stocks we are going to find out what is the root cause of this fall and what are the future prospects of this stock to bounce back this is the most important step because here I speaking about individual research of that stock and try to find out what is the root cause really so let me give you a practical example of indust in bank which has recently Fallen by no means it's a recommendation I'm picking up this as a case study only so that you understand how to practically go and research a particular beaten down stock you are going to learn a lot with this particular case study so what do you see on my screen is that indust in Bank on 10th of March came out with a official statement first thing please note is that I'm saying official statement please make sure that you're not relying on any Media news whenever you are doing research about the Beaten Down stocks because media news may include rumors what you need to do is go to the official statement of the company that the company might have released if they haven't yet released then please for it don't be in a rush to go and invest in a beaten down stock unless you understand the root cause that is given by the company itself so here for example 10th of March they came out with this statement and what was the summary of this that there are some accounting discrepancies that the company has found themselves and what they're saying is that because of these accounting discrepancies their net worth was declared 2.3% higher than what it actually is this is what their internal review is saying and now we understand a the root cause and the scale of the problem that the the company is saying so the immediate question should come in your mind is that is this company now going to fall or bankrupt or go into Administration or going to lose everything that they've built over a period of time for this what you need to do is look at what the regulatory bodies are saying in this particular example so for example what RBI came out with a statement on 15th of March is that there is no problem as such with the indes and Banks liquidity coverage ratio and things like that it means the bank is well capitalized so the chances of this going down badly is very very limited right now as RBI has come out in public and have made an statement here however at the same time What RBI has done is it has laid down here the timeline that by Q4 F525 Bank must complete this analysis and must actually take some remedial action this is the timeline that the RBI has set this is very very important for us to know what is going to come up in the future as well now after RBI statement on 20th of March indust in Bank came out with another official statement saying that they have now engaged or appointed an independent professional firm to now conduct a comprehensive review so what is going to happen in the next few weeks is that there is going to be a comprehensive review done by this independent professional firm and they are going to tell exactly how much is the damage what are these accounting discrepancies so right now if you ask me there is lot of uncertainty in this particular company we don't know what is likely to come out of this comprehensive review now there are two types of investor investor a may say that you know what I want to avoid this stock up until I get the full clarity of what the hell is going on here investor B might say that you know what I don't want to wait until then because right now the price is down because of uncertainty the moment everything becomes clear then the stock price may not be what it is right now so the both investors have their own mindset and here the investor who is more experienced will know that this has happened with many other Banks and this is how they came out and this is how long it took for them to come out but again I've given you this view in terms of how to go about really going down down to the bottom of the problem and trying to find out what are the future Prospect is the company actually going to go down or that is not the case it's a matter of timing here where we need to wait and watch and you might say that as an investor I want to wait to see what is really happening here again not a recommendation either ways but I've picked up this live case study so that you understand how to go and do the research about what is the root cause of this fall and what are the future prospects of this company with that let's move to step number seven and if you're just wondering that how many more steps to go I can only tell one thing that if you do a thorough comprehensive job then you are not going to make mistakes my intent is not to give you substandard content my intent is to be very very honest with you and give you the steps that I personally follow therefore please bear with me we are going to finish very very soon so let's go to step number seven which is have a look at the valuations in the sector itself for example if you're picking up a beaten down stock that belongs to banking sector what you really need to make sure is that are there any other opportunities that look better than this opportunity from a valuation perspective so simple checks you can do for example here on my screen from a banking perspective p ratio PB ratio PEG ratio you can just compare these and see again taking the same example of indust in bank because of this price damage what has happened here is the p ratio has come down PB ratio has come down here so the question here is that is there any other bank which is still more attractive from a valuation perspective rather than this particular stock then in that case because that stock has not beaten down and still at a better valuation why would you invest in this beaten down stock is the question we need to ask but typically what happens is that if a stock is beaten down by more than 50% you are unlikely to find stocks that are trading at a better valuation than this particular company but still we need to make sure that we do this check as well now comes step number eight which is is the stock still falling or has the price stabilized it's a very very important check we need to do because if a stock is still falling you might catch a falling knife as they say therefore what we need to do is we need to pick a stock at entry price which is more stabilized entry price this is a mistake that many people make they might have done all the good work and they end up picking a stock at a very very wrong price when it is still falling so for example here have a look at my screen you will see in this particular stock chart what you notice is that the stock price almost stabilized between 300 to 400 level for almost a period of let's say 4 to 6 months this is a good period where the consolidation has happened and more importantly all the bad news by now would have been out of the way some clarities would have emerged if the stock has been beaten down this stabilization period is extremely important for you to wait and watch don't be in a rush to just pick a stock because all of a sudden it's Fallen by 20% you don't know it can fall by another 20% or another 30% it is extremely hard to judge the bottom the only way to limit your downside is to look for the stabilization in the price I've shown you this example here so that you understand what I mean by stabilization now comes my step number nine which is the rating agency view so when a stock has hit some bad problems what happens is the rating agencies will start to view the ratings that they have issued for example here in the case of indust in bank chrysil they are still holding off in terms of giving them downgrade or upgrade it's an important important parameter for you to see how many rating agencies have covered that particular company and what are they actually saying you will get a very very good Insight from what the rating agencies are telling you again I've taken this example here for example chrysil is holding the rating for indes they really want to see what comes out of these investigations that the independent firm is going another rating agency here Moody is what they're saying is that their Base Credit assessment rating which is BCA they are potentially going to downgrade depending on what comes out of these reports so again this gives you a sense in terms of where the market is sentimentally playing these because the moment rating agencies downgrade the companies there typically is a selloff right and you don't want to be caught up into that selloff mode what you want to do is make sure you're reading these agency ratings as well to get a complete picture and finally my step number 10 which is the overall sector exposure that you have so if you're picking up a banking stock and if you've done the thorough job in terms of going through all these nine steps the last question you need to really ask yourself is that am I Overexposed to the sector that I'm going to pick this stock from so for example if banking stock you're going to pick up because it has passed all the nine steps is your portfolio Overexposed to Banks or not very very important portfolio level balancing you need to do typically within a sector you don't want to be exposed by more than 25% is a good thumb of rule that typically I use and I've seen many other people using it so I've sort of copied this from many other people that 25% is a very very good thumb rule that you shouldn't be really having high exposure to one sector there is lot of risk all of sudden things change then you're likely to lose money so please make sure you do step number 10 which is what is your overall exposure and do you have room to add one more stock is what the call you need to take at your portfolio level just before I finish the video I teach all of these practical insights on my YouTube Community if you're not yet a member and want to get daily insightful updates
